# Standalone Cafe

This is a simple cafe software for Windows 10 PC allowing timing use of a Windows account using tickets with a range of durations.
User enters ticket number for a specific time of use and is locked out when ticket time expires.

## Setting Up
* Download the code to a preferred location and pip install modules in `requirements.txt`
* Run the `createTickets.py` file by doubleclicking or from cmd to create your tickets within the program directory. The tickets will be output to a file named `tickets.txt`
* To run the app, double click on the file `cafe.pyw`
* For better security, you can move the file `tickets.txt` to an inaccessible location so that others cant access the tickets. Also you can add `cafe.pyw` to startup programs so that the cafe starts when the user signs in to their account. For more security you can create a non-administrator account, disable task manager and control panel and auto start the cafe in that account.
